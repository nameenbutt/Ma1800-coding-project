<h2>Notebook Entry 03</h2>

<p>
Between the lines of her diary, she taped small audio notes:
    a boy recalling the <a href="Timeline.html" style="color:#4a90e2;">night the sky turned orange</a>
       an old man speaking the name of every street he lost.
          a mother reciting dua in the hallway.
</p>

<p>
She wrote:
"Their voices should not disappear."
