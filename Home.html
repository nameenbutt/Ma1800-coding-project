<h2>Notebook Entry 01</h2>
<p>
    She kept a small notebook during the years of unrest.
    In its pages, she wrote about the <a href="Timeline.html" style="text-decoration:none; color:#4a90e2;">days that changed the country</a>
    Some entries were hopeful.
    Some were warnings.
    Some were prayers under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
On the first page, she glued a picture of a <a href="Faith & conflict.html" style="text-decoration:none; color:#4a90e2;">mosque</a>
    where the dust settled slowly after every explosion.
    </p>

<img src="images/Mosque.jpeg" alt="Mosque" style="width:100%; border-radius:10 px; margin:20px 0;">

<p>
   There were also fragments written sideways along the margins:
   "They said the smoke rose for hours."
   "The prayers still reached us."
   "Nothing stayed quiet for long."
</p>

<p>
She didn't expect anyone to read these pages,
    but you found them here - in her <a href="voices.html" style="text-decoration:none; color:#4a90e2">voices</a>
