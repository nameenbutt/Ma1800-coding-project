# Ma1800-coding-project
I created my digital web art project specifically to explore how war, faith, memory, and everyday life overlap in Pakistan's recent and historical landscape. I thought instead of designing a traditional website, I decided to construct a story through the style of a broken diary. This format allowed me to express the emotional complexity of conflict  - the way memories are often fragmented and selective and are carried across times through small traces. The main structural inspiration for this project was Olia Lialina's, My Boyfriend Came Back From the War, web art project, a foundational work in early net-art. Lialina's use of fragments, whispers, and nonlinear links tells a story that feels personal and interactive at the same time. What stood out to me was how she used the limitations of early web design - split screens, text blocks, and repeated motifs - to create a sense of broken communications. I wanted to recreate that so I drew from her underlying method: letting viewers assemble the meaning  themselves by moving through scattered pieces of information, and I found my project would be more interesting if I created a diary, full of notebook entries of someone else's perspective. In my project, the diary belongs to an unamed woman living through key eras of conflict in Pakistan, I selected particular years - 1947, 1965, 1971 and 2001-present - this was not to retell historical events, but to show how these events shape private memory. Instead of writing explanations, I used short fragments: marginal notes, prayers under the breath, torn photogaraphs, and traces of erased sentences. I figured this approach humanised the narrative by focusing on a lived experience rather than peoples intepreattion of historical events. Throughout this site, I used visual cues that evoke the physicality of a diary, and I achieved this by adding scrap frames, taped images, soft handwritten-style captions and hidden links placed inside for the viewers so they can interact with the project. This reflects how history is often recorded through not just through offical archives but through everyday objects like diaries, memories, oral stories and family recollections, with this being said, I aimed to recreate that sense of intimacy and vunerability. 

Each page functions as a "notebook entry". The home page introduces the idea of fragments collected during unrest, whereas the timeline page uses selectives dates to show how she chooses which memories are worth to be written and which remain too painful to share to the viewers. Furthermore, the voices page transitions into oral memories - a boy recalling the night the sky turned aorange, a mother reciting sua, an old man listing the names of vanished streets, to show the impact of war through all ages and how countless voices are still undocumented and silenced. The faith and conflict page returns to the tension between religious resilience and the repeated return of violence, while the reflection page leaves a blank space for the viewer, this last page is important as it invites the viewer to participate in the narrative, sharing their voices and highlighting how memory and storytelling depend on shared interpretation. Also, I made deliberate technical decisions to reinforce the concept. The project uses simple HTML and CSS to keep the focus on the story, mirroring how Lialina used minimalism to heighten emotional impact. The lack of heavy animation or complex interaction is intnentional; I wanted the experience to feel slow, reflective and almost like turning pages hand by hand. 

Research was a key part in the development of this project. Although the writing is fictional, it draws from real historical contexts: the trauma of Partition, the wars of 1965 and 1971, years of political tensions, and the rise of terrorism and military conflict after 2001. A lot of my research came from stories from grandparents and family from back home, there were also a lot of documentaries and videos about Pakistan as well that I researched on. Instead of using the events academically, I focused on how ordinary people experience them - through fear, prayer, loss, routine and quiet resilience. I also drew on the representations of conflict in South Asians literature and oral storytelling traditions, where memory is often preserved in fragments rather than formal documentation.
