# Ma1800-coding-project
I created my digital web art project specifically to explore how war, faith, memory, and everyday life overlap in PaKistan. I thought the best way to capture this idea was to tell a story through the style of a broken diary rather than a traditional website. I was inspired by Olia Lialina's, My Boyfriend Came Back From the War, web art project, especially the way she used fragments, whispers, and nonlinear links to tell a story that feels personal and interactive at the same time. I wanted to recreate that by putting my own twist to it, and I did this by creating a diary through someone else's perspective. In this project, I wanted to include Pakistan's long history of conflict - moments of fears, use of prayers, and voices that refused to disappear at that dark time in the country. Each page on the site works like a notebook entry, with taped photos, and hidden links that lets the viewers move through the story in their own way. Instead of just presenting facts, I tried to humanise the experience, showing how history is carried in small pieces: in the dust after blast, in small duas, in names of streets that no longer exist. This project is my way of preserving these emotional fragments and letting others feel what it means to live between faith and fire.
